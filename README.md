# Penetration-Testing-Report
In this report, I have included executive summary, methodology/approach, results (which can be duplicated),  conclusion/suggestion and appendix. I have drafted my own security assessment on two ubuntu machines (assume it is a small network) using my own script (vulner.sh attached under my repository for Penetration Testing Project)
